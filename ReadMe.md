## Introduction
I am learning code. Both from self study and a program.  This is a simple quiz game I copied from pintrest using simple if and else statements and modified to my own.  Since I have began my education I consulted with AI to create GUI for it. 

## FAMILYGUYQUIZ
This is version 1.0 if you will.  It uses if and else statements with custom responses. Simply type yes or no at the prompt to begin.

## FAMILGUYQUIZ-V2
This is where the GUI interface started being added. This changed the if and else statments and required some importing. Through the versions, I added hyperlinks to images, somewhat directed size of windows, sound clips, custom responses as well. 

## Future
I intend to add custom audio for the responses and would like to add score keeper as well.  I lack the knowledge but am eager to learn.
